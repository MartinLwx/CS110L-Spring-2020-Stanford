## CS110L: Safety in Systems Programming
## Hi 👋

This is my personal learning record for the CS110L: Safety in Systems Programming of the Stanford.

## Resources

All materials can be found on this offical page: <https://reberhardt.com/cs110l/spring-2020>

The starter code can be found on this repo: <https://github.com/reberhardt7/cs110l-spr-2020-starter-code>

## Exercises

- [x] [week1. Hello world](./Exercises/week1)
- [x] [week2. Ownership and structs](./Exercises/week2)
- [x] [week3. Error handling, I/O, and traits](./Exercises/week3)
- [x] [week5. Farm meets multithreading](./Exercises/week5)
- [x] [week6. Sharing Data by Communicating](./Exercises/week6)

## Projects

- [x] [proj1. The DEET Debugger](./Projects/proj1-deet)

## Highlights

- Basic and intermediate Rust programming 👍 e.g. *Ownership, traits, multithreading, etc*
- Memory safety 👍
- System programming 👍
- How to design a better system? e.g. *Error handling, information security, etc"
